= GQLForum

== Report 1

It's just too much work to implement an entire forum from SQL up.

The difficult part is not GraphQL. In fact, I feel like for complex queries it is easier than REST. However, given that I have no background in SQL, I find it really hard to query the results into nice structures.

Also, any queries performed this way is not optimized.

I will just use Hasura for future development.

== Report 2

Hasura is great... except when I needed to ask questions in the community, because nobody is responding. So I am coming back here.

Hopefully I can create a project template at some point.
