== Design Choices

=== N+1

N+1 is not purposefully avoided.
Joins are used to ensure correctness and access control, but not for performance (yet).
See: https://www.sqlite.org/np1queryprob.html.

=== Access Control

Metadata consistency and access control are ensured on SQL queries instead of at application level.
Access control comes in form of 4 views: `topic_permissions`, `topic_public`, `post_permissions`, and `post_public`.
